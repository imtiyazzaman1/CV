A former science teacher,  gym enthusiast and all around tech nerd. I love challenging myself and solving problems and I’m excited to take this passion into a new industry. Currently a Fellowship student at Makers Academy, I’m interested in working in a supportive environment which can challenge me and help me grow as a developer

## Skills

#### Communication

Given the sometimes abstract nature of science, teaching in inner London schools honed my ability to communicate challenging concepts to my students in meaningful and insightful ways. This also allowed me to develop my ability to question effectively, a skill I used to identify the misconceptions my students had, in order to inform the direction my lessons needed to take.

It was also imperative that I communicated effectively with my fellow colleagues regarding any concerns about students and how to best support them. As a result of our efforts, our students achieved half a grade higher compared to similar students nationally in their Combined Science GCSE in 2018.

#### Disciplined

During the summer of 2014, I joined the weightlifting club at university. The club was due to compete at a regional competition in December and despite the competition date being 6 months away, my strength was far from where I wanted it to be. In this time leading up to the competition, I was required to attend rigorous training sessions five days a week, maintain a strict eating schedule in order to put on weight and make sure that I kept a consistent sleep schedule to allow my body to recover. This discipline and dedication led me to place amongst the Top 10 in the competition.

Since then, I have been able to implement this level of discipline to my career as a teacher as well as my own strength & conditioning training.

#### Problem Solving

While teaching, I had to deal very quickly with unpredictable problems in a classroom, from  managing with technical difficulties to resolving fights and disputes, while minimising the disruption posed to the rest of the class. For instances, during a network crash, lesson resources were unavailable and I was left to teach for 100 mins with a whiteboard, a pen and my wits.

My problems solving skills are also reflected in my approach to my strength and conditioning training. I suffered several injuries from weightlifting and rather than giving up on the progress I had made, I took it upon myself to identify the specific muscles I had injured, how to rehabilitate them and how to prevent any similar injuries reoccurring.
